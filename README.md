This project is introducing an interesting application for a robotic car using a group of most commonly used sensors. Basically, the robotic car will be implemented as a multi tasks car, that can be controlled remotely using a Bluetooth sensor, self-drive using Ultrasonic Sensor, and self-drive using Line Following Sensor. However, the project has been implemented firstly, in the software via Tinkercad for the purpose of verification, and secondly in the hardware using the Arduino Mega platform. Besides, using some helpful methods such as the truth table of the line follower application for the purpose of regulating the car turns. Eventually, the robotic car has been successfully implemented and worked exactly as desired.

1-	Bluetooth Control
After implementing the required connections on the breadboard and the Arduino Mega, we started writing the required code to perform the Bluetooth control task.

2-	Obstacle Avoidance
After implementing the required connections of the servo motor and blog with the Ultrasonic sensor on the breadboard and the Arduino Mega, we started writing the required code to perform the Obstacle Avoidance task.

3-	Line Follower
After implementing the required connections of the 5 IR sensors and blog them to the bottom of the robotic car up to the breadboard and the Arduino Mega, we started writing the required code to perform the Line Following task.

Integrated Combined Functions 
After implementing the required connections of the two switches in order to program it to do all the three tasks.  
However, we have done all the connections on the breadboard and the Arduino, and then we start to write the code of the combination of tasks. 
Then we uploaded the code to the Arduino Mega. 
Eventually, we test the robotic car with all the commands to check if itâ€™s going to perform all of the desired tasks, and the robotic car has been worked successfully.
